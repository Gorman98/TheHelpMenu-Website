    <h4>By Rob Thubron | 2018/11/25</h4>
    <p>What does Fallout 76 have in common with Aliens: Colonial Marines, Mafia 3, and No Man’s Sky? It’s one of those high-profile games that’s been universally panned by critics. But, like No Man’s Sky, could Bethesda’s title eventually receive enough patches and updates to make it worth playing?</p.

<p>There was disappointment when it was revealed that the next entry in the Fallout series was going to have a multiplayer focus, rather than featuring a single-player campaign that the other games are known for. But as the likes of Fortnite, Overwatch, and PUBG remain so popular, perhaps Fallout 76 could emulate this success? The answer turns out to be… No, far from it.</p>

<p>There was some initial hype around Fallout 76, and the West Virginia trailer helped heighten that excitement. However, the response to the game’s beta was lukewarm at best. Yet even that wouldn’t have prepared Bethesda for what's become their worst-reviewed game since Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow.</p>

<p>Reviewers have complained about the lack of NPCs, the aging engine, the weak main plot, and an overall experience that can feel more like a monotonous chore than fun. There are also a ton of bugs that make the game even less enjoyable. All of which has resulted in a Metacritic score of 50, and even worse user ratings.</p>

<p>With an 80 percent drop in retail sales compared to Fallout 4, Fallout 76 has already had its price temporarily reduced – down 33 percent to $40 – less than two weeks after launch.</p>

<p>So, what does the future hold for Fallout 76? Most of the critical reviews do point out that there are some enjoyable elements, and Bethesda has promised a ton of updates to address the bugs and try to improve the overall experience. Will it be enough, though? The company doubtlessly hopes it can copy No Man’s Sky, which was lambasted on release following months of hype, but July’s ‘Next’ update morphed it into the game people had been expecting at launch, driving No Man’s Sky to the top of the Steam charts almost 2 years after it arrived. It remains to be seen, however, whether Fallout 76 will finally become a great and popular game in 2020.</p>

Gamers should be ready to buy a PS4 to play Last of Us Part 2 as Ellie from the first game, with some gameplay mechanics new to the title that will really add to the survival horror feel of the game.'

        summary: "Rockstar Games previously said that the Red Dead Online beta would arrive before the end of November. It's now November 25, and it's still nothing but crickets. As Rockstar seemingly runs out of time to launch the highly-anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2 mode, some Xbox One and PS4 players have apparently already gotten their hands on the beta, as Red Dead Redemption 2's Red Dead Online-specific achievements are currently being popped by a very small percentage of players."
