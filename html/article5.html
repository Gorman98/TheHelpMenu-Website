    <h1>Red Dead Online Delayed Again</h1>

    <h4>By Tyler Fischer | 2018/11/25</h4>
    <p>Rockstar Games previously said that the Red Dead Online beta would arrive before the end of November. It's now November 25, and it's still nothing but crickets. As Rockstar Games seemingly runs out of time to launch the highly-anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2 mode, some players have apparently already gotten their hands on the beta. Red Dead Redemption 2's Red Dead Online-specific achievements are currently being popped by a very small percentage of players.</p>

<p>Achievements, such as "Breakout," which are dished out for completing the intro of Red Dead Online, have previously sat at 0 percent since the game's launch. But now said achievements are at 0.01% percent. This doesn't just confirm that people are playing the beta live, but also eludes to the fact that Rockstar Games is getting ready to roll the sucker out.</p>

<p>Now, it's worth pointing out that this exclusive 0.01 percent is likely developers of Red Dead Online and testers rather than random players, though this can't be known for certain. Whatever the case may be, as mentioned above, all that matters is the signal it broadcasts… Red Dead Online is imminent!</p>

<p>Rockstar Games has been very quiet about Red Dead Online. Therefore, we don't have any clue on what to expect from it. Will it be similar to the online of Red Dead Redemption? Or more akin to Grand Theft Auto Online? The answer is almost certainly the latter -after all, it made endless truckloads of cash money for Rockstar and Take-Two Interactive- but it's possible it will maybe even be a hybrid of both. Only Rockstar Games and these early players know… For now.</p>

Gamers should be ready to buy a PS4 to play Last of Us Part 2 as Ellie from the first game, with some gameplay mechanics new to the title that will really add to the survival horror feel of the game.'

        summary: 'Any Fallout fan with a PS4, Xbox One, or PC gets hyped when a new game is announced. But what does Fallout 76 have in common with Aliens: Colonial Marines, Mafia 3, and No Man’s Sky? It’s one of those high-profile games that’s been universally panned by critics. But, like No Man’s Sky, could Bethesda’s title eventually receive enough patches and updates to make it worth playing?'
