    <h4>By Kirk McKeand | 2018/11/23</h4>
    <p> While no release data has been announced yet, but Naughty Dog and Sony were able to show fans some fresh gameplay (including in-game footage) at E3 2018 that has fans hyped up.</p>

<p>In the first game, players got the chance to control both Joel and Ellie at certain points in the story. Naughty Dog has said Joel still plays a big part in this sequel, but you will only ever be able to play as Ellie for this one.</p>

<p>Just like in the first game, Ellie won’t be on her own for this adventure. Naughty Dog confirmed in a recent interview that Ellie will be joined by an AI companion throughout – the developer just isn’t ready to tell us who that is just yet.</p>

<p>This sequel will play similarly to the first game, though there’s been a few tweaks. For starters, there’s a dedicated prone button now. You can crawl under vehicles, through long grass, and sneak about like Solid Snake. There’s also a visibility indicator that shows how hidden you are at any time, making the game’s stealth more readable.</p>

<p>On top of that, there’s also a dedicated dodge button. In combat, you can tap dodge to avoid incoming strikes and arrows. Ellie’s animations are contextual when you dodge, so she might slam into a car to avoid an axe swing, for example. You can also jump on demand.</p>

<p>Another area of improvement is the enemy AI. The main group of human enemies communicate with whistles, and you have to decode what the whistles mean if you want to understand their plans. A new technical advancement Naughty Dog is experimenting with also allows the AI to know each other by name, making them seem more believable as actual people. Even if they do want to gut you.</p>

        summary: 'Any Fallout fan with a PS4, Xbox One, or PC gets hyped when a new game is announced. But what does Fallout 76 have in common with Aliens: Colonial Marines, Mafia 3, and No Man’s Sky? It’s one of those high-profile games that’s been universally panned by critics. But, like No Man’s Sky, could Bethesda’s title eventually receive enough patches and updates to make it worth playing?'

        summary: "Rockstar Games previously said that the Red Dead Online beta would arrive before the end of November. It's now November 25, and it's still nothing but crickets. As Rockstar seemingly runs out of time to launch the highly-anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2 mode, some Xbox One and PS4 players have apparently already gotten their hands on the beta, as Red Dead Redemption 2's Red Dead Online-specific achievements are currently being popped by a very small percentage of players."
